### Fixes Hallucinations.

LLMs hallucinate a lot when it comes to Terraform. This skill fixes it. It includes best practices for Terraform and OpenTofu - good, bad, and neutral examples so the AI avoids common mistakes. Using TerraShark, the AI keeps proven practices in mind, eliminates hallucinations, and defaults to modular, reusable, security-first design.

### Very Token-Efficient.

Most Terraform skills dump huge text-of-walls onto the agent and burn expensive tokens - with no upside. LLMs don't need the entire Terraform docs again. TerraShark was aggressively de-duplicated and optimized for maximum quality per token.

### Based on HashiCorp's Official Best Practices.

TerraShark is primarily based on [HashiCorp official recommended practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/recommended-practices). When guidance conflicts, it prioritizes HashiCorp's recommendations.

## ⚡ 2 min Quickstart

### Option 1: Clone

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukasNiessen/terrashark.git ~/.claude/skills/terrashark
```

**Windows (Powershell):**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/LukasNiessen/terrashark.git "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\terrashark"
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/LukasNiessen/terrashark.git "%USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\terrashark"
```

That's it. Claude Code auto-discovers skills in `~/.claude/skills/` — no restart needed.

### Option 2: Marketplace

Claude Code has a built-in plugin system with marketplace support. Instead of cloning manually, you can add TerraShark's marketplace and install directly from the CLI:

```
/plugin marketplace add LukasNiessen/terrashark
/plugin install terrashark
```

Or use the interactive plugin manager — run `/plugin`, switch to the **Discover** tab, and install from there. The marketplace reads the `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in this repo to register TerraShark as an installable plugin.

### Option 3: Codex

Codex has no global skill system — setup is per-project. Clone TerraShark into your repo and reference it from your `AGENTS.md`:

```bash
# Clone into your project root
git clone https://github.com/LukasNiessen/terrashark.git .terrashark
```

Then add to your `AGENTS.md` (or create one in the repo root):

```markdown
## Terraform

When working with Terraform or OpenTofu, follow the workflow in `.terrashark/SKILL.md`.
Load references from `.terrashark/references/` as needed.
```

### That's it!

Done. Now ask Claude Code / Codex any Terraform question. TerraShark responses follow the 7-step failure-mode workflow and include an output contract with assumptions, tradeoffs, and rollback notes.

**Invoke explicitly:**

```bash
/terrashark Create a multi-region S3 module with replication
```

```bash
/terrashark Refactor our EKS stack into separate state files per environment, add moved blocks to avoid recreation, set up a GitHub Actions pipeline with plan on PR and gated apply on merge, and wire in Checkov for compliance scanning
```

**Or just ask naturally** — TerraShark activates automatically for any Terraform/OpenTofu task:

```
Review my main.tf for security issues
```

```
Migrate this module from count to for_each
```

### TerraShark vs terraform-skill

The key difference is architectural. **terraform-skill** is a static reference manual: it dumps ~4,400 tokens into context on every activation, then loads additional reference files that can be over 1,000 lines each. It gives Claude information but never tells it _how to think_ about a problem. There's no diagnosis step, no risk assessment, and no structured output — Claude reads the reference and generates whatever it thinks fits.

**TerraShark** takes the opposite approach. The core SKILL.md is a 79-line operational workflow that costs ~600 tokens on activation — **over 7x leaner**. Instead of front-loading a wall of text, it forces Claude through a diagnostic sequence: capture context → identify failure modes → load _only_ the relevant references → propose fixes with explicit risk controls → validate → deliver a structured output contract.

This matters for three reasons:

1. **Token efficiency.** terraform-skill burns ~4,400 tokens just to activate, before any reference files. A single reference file like `module-patterns.md` (1,126 lines, ~7,000 tokens) can double the cost again. TerraShark's activation is ~600 tokens, and its 18 granular reference files mean Claude loads only what's needed — typically one or two small, focused docs instead of one massive dump.

2. **Hallucination prevention.** terraform-skill provides good patterns but never asks Claude to _diagnose what could go wrong_. TerraShark's Step 2 forces failure-mode identification before any code is generated. Step 4 requires explicit risk controls for every fix. Step 7 enforces an output contract with assumptions, tradeoffs, and rollback notes. This is the difference between giving someone a cookbook and giving them a diagnostic checklist.

3. **Reference coverage.** TerraShark ships 18 focused reference files covering failure modes, migration playbooks, good/bad/neutral examples, do/don't checklists, compliance framework mappings, and MCP integration. terraform-skill has 6 larger files that go deep on testing and module patterns but lack migration playbooks, explicit anti-pattern banks, compliance mappings beyond a few frameworks, and MCP guidance.

**In short:** TerraShark is the better skill due to 7x leaner activation, failure-mode-first diagnostic workflow, output contracts, granular references, and LLM-specific hallucination prevention. terraform-skill wins on HCL example depth and testing docs, but TerraShark's architecture is fundamentally better designed for the core use case of LLM-assisted IaC generation.

## 🕵️ Token Strategy

- Keep `SKILL.md` procedural and compact
- Keep references focused on failure-prone decisions
- Exclude broad tutorial material with low safety impact
- Add depth only when measured quality would otherwise drop

See `references/token-balance-rationale.md` for the full decision and tradeoffs.

## 🧱 Trusted Module Awareness

Hand-rolled `resource` blocks are one of the largest hallucination surfaces for LLMs — attribute names, defaults, and iteration shapes are where models drift. TerraShark recognizes the major vendor-maintained and community module registries and defaults to using them instead of generating raw resources, whenever a mature module covers the requested service.

### How it helps

- A pinned registry module replaces hundreds of lines of hand-rolled HCL with a version-locked interface already tested across many production stacks
- Removes attribute-name, default-value, and `for_each` drift — the exact spots where LLMs slip
- Enforces **exact** version pinning for production, so module upgrades don't silently change generated resource addresses

### When it loads (lean-token approach)

`references/trusted-modules.md` is pulled into context **only when the detected provider is one of the supported clouds**. AWS-only projects never pay the token cost for Azure or GCP guidance, and vice versa — matching TerraShark's core token-efficiency design.

### Supported providers

| Cloud        | Registry namespace         | Program                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| AWS          | `terraform-aws-modules`    | Community standard                 |
| Azure        | `Azure`                    | Azure Verified Modules (AVM)       |
| GCP          | `terraform-google-modules` | Cloud Foundation Toolkit           |
| Oracle Cloud | `oracle-terraform-modules` | Vendor-maintained                  |
| IBM Cloud    | `terraform-ibm-modules`    | IBM Deployable Architectures       |

Other ecosystems (Alibaba Cloud, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, etc.) are intentionally not included yet — their module programs are still small or early-stage, so recommending them as defaults would trade one failure mode (hallucinated attributes) for another (unmaintained wrappers). If a provider's ecosystem matures, it can be added later.

## 🐣 What's Included

- A focused `SKILL.md` execution flow
- Failure-mode-first guidance to prevent common IaC hallucinations
- Core failure-mode references: identity churn, secret exposure, blast radius, CI drift, compliance gates
- Expanded architecture guidance (state, boundaries, module roles)
- Refactor/migration playbooks for safe evolution
- Stronger CI/CD and governance patterns (including Atlantis + Infracost)
- Risk-based test depth guidance with native test caveats and Terratest coverage
- Rewritten good/bad/neutral example bank
- Do/Don't pattern bank and MCP integration guidance
- Trusted community/vendor module awareness (AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, IBM) loaded conditionally

## 🔎 How It Works

The skill runs as a failure-mode workflow whenever Claude Code handles Terraform or OpenTofu tasks:

1. **Capture execution context** - Runtime/version, providers, backend, execution path, risk level
2. **Diagnose likely failure mode(s)** - Identity churn, secret exposure, blast radius, CI drift, compliance gate gaps
3. **Load only relevant references** - Pull targeted guidance for the failure mode(s) in scope
4. **Propose fix path with controls** - Include risk notes, approvals, tests, and rollback expectations
5. **Generate implementation artifacts** - HCL changes, migration blocks, CI/policy updates
6. **Validate before finalize** - Runtime-appropriate command sequence and risk-tier checks
7. **Deliver complete output** - Assumptions, remediation choices, tradeoffs, validation plan, recovery notes

## 🐲 Scope

- Terraform and OpenTofu module design/review/refactoring
- Safe migration workflows for existing stacks
- CI/CD and policy integration for infrastructure delivery
- Blast-radius reduction and operational safety

## ℹ️ FAQ

**Q: Does this work with OpenTofu?**

Yes. TerraShark supports both Terraform and OpenTofu. The workflow captures runtime/version first and adapts guidance accordingly.

**Q: Will this slow down my AI interactions?**

No. The skill is designed for low token overhead. Only relevant references should be loaded for a given failure mode.

**Q: Can I use this outside Claude Code?**

Yes. The references are plain Markdown and can be used from any workflow or AI assistant, **including Codex**. The trigger behavior in `SKILL.md` is optimized for skill-enabled environments.

**Q: How was the content validated?**

We started with much larger references and a large automated test suite, then repeatedly removed sections and re-tested. If quality dropped, content was restored. If quality stayed stable, content remained out.
